Personality Traits
d6  Personality Trait
1   Strange events and otherworldly creatures don’t faze me.
2   I think in terms of exchange: something for something, nothing for nothing.
3   I speak with an unusual cadence.
4   I pepper my speech with words or curses borrowed from planar languages.
5   I’ve seen enough to know that you can’t take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone.
6   I have a superstitious habit I picked up from my gate-town, such as touching iron when I’m nervous or arranging objects in a specific order.

BUILDING A GATE WARDEN
Those who dwell for an extended time near a permanent portal to another plane absorb the essence radiating from the realm beyond. Those influenced by the same plane share similarities in behavior and even physical appearance.
