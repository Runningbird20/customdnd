CLERIC CLASS FEATURES - D&D

================================================================================
LEVEL 1: SPELLCASTING
================================================================================
PHB'24 p70

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class's description.

Cantrips: You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance, Sacred Flame, and Thaumaturgy are recommended.

Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.

When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.

Spell Slots: The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+: You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.

If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells: Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability: Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.

Spellcasting Focus: You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.

================================================================================
LEVEL 1: DIVINE ORDER
================================================================================
PHB'24 p70

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

PROTECTOR: Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.

THAUMATURGE: You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).

================================================================================
LEVEL 2: CHANNEL DIVINITY
================================================================================
PHB'24 p70

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.

You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.

If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting feature.

DIVINE SPARK: As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).

You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).

TURN UNDEAD: As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.

================================================================================
LEVEL 3: CLERIC SUBCLASS
================================================================================
PHB'24 p71

You gain a Cleric subclass of your choice. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Cleric levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass's features that are of your Cleric level or lower.

================================================================================
ARCANA DOMAIN
================================================================================
SCAG p125

Magic is an energy that suffuses the multiverse and that fuels both destruction and creation. Gods of the Arcana domain know the secrets and potential of magic intimately. For some of these gods, magical knowledge is a great responsibility that comes with a special understanding of the nature of reality. Other gods of Arcana see magic as pure power, to be used as its wielder sees fit.

ARCANA DOMAIN SPELLS
Cleric Level | Spells
1st          | detect magic, magic missile
3rd          | magic weapon, Nystul's magic aura
5th          | dispel magic, magic circle
7th          | arcane eye, Leomund's secret chest
9th          | planar binding, teleportation circle

--- Arcane Initiate (Level 1) ---
SCAG p125

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency in the Arcana skill, and you gain two cantrips of your choice from the wizard spell list. For you, these cantrips count as cleric cantrips.

--- Channel Divinity: Arcane Abjuration (Level 2) ---
SCAG p125

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to abjure otherworldly creatures.

As an action, you present your holy symbol, and one celestial, elemental, fey, or fiend of your choice that is within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw, provided that the creature can see or hear you. If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.

A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, then the creature can use the Dodge action.

After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the banishment spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin, and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown below.

ARCANE BANISHMENT
Cleric level | Banishes Creatures of CR...
5th          | 1/2 or lower
8th          | 1 or lower
11th         | 2 or lower
14th         | 3 or lower
17th         | 4 or lower

--- Spell Breaker (Level 6) ---
SCAG p125

Starting at 6th level, when you restore hit points to an ally with a spell of 1st level or higher, you can also end one spell of your choice on that creature. The level of the spell you end must be equal to or lower than the level of the spell slot you use to cast the healing spell.

--- Arcane Mastery (Level 17) ---
SCAG p125

At 17th level, you choose four spells from the Wizard spell list, one from each of the following levels: 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th. You add them to your list of domain spells. Like your other domain spells, they are always prepared and count as cleric spells for you.

================================================================================
DEATH DOMAIN
================================================================================
DMG'14 p96

The Death domain is concerned with the forces that cause death, as well as the negative energy that gives rise to undead creatures. Deities such as Chemosh, Myrkul, and Wee Jas are patrons of necromancers, death knights, liches, mummy lords, and vampires. Gods of the Death domain also embody murder (Anubis, Bhaal, and Pyremius), pain (Iuz or Loviatar), disease or poison (Incabulos, Talona, or Morgion), and the underworld (Hades and Hel).

DEATH DOMAIN SPELLS
Cleric Level | Spells
1st          | false life, ray of sickness
3rd          | blindness/deafness, ray of enfeeblement
5th          | animate dead, vampiric touch
7th          | blight, death ward
9th          | antilife shell, cloudkill

--- Bonus Proficiency (Level 1) ---
DMG'14 p96

When the cleric chooses this domain at 1st level, he or she gains proficiency with martial weapons.

--- Reaper (Level 1) ---
DMG'14 p96

At 1st level, the cleric learns one necromancy cantrip of his or her choice from any spell list. When the cleric casts a necromancy cantrip that normally targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other.

--- Channel Divinity: Touch of Death (Level 2) ---
DMG'14 p96

Starting at 2nd level, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to destroy another creature's life force by touch.

When the cleric hits a creature with a melee attack, the cleric can use Channel Divinity to deal extra necrotic damage to the target. The damage equals 5 + twice his or her cleric level.

--- Inescapable Destruction (Level 6) ---
DMG'14 p96

Starting at 6th level, the cleric's ability to channel negative energy becomes more potent. Necrotic damage dealt by the character's cleric spells and Channel Divinity options ignores resistance to necrotic damage.

--- Improved Reaper (Level 17) ---
DMG'14 p96

Starting at 17th level, when the cleric casts a Necromancy spell of 1st through 5th-level that targets only one creature, the spell can instead target two creatures within range and within 5 feet of each other. If the spell consumes its material components, the cleric must provide them for each target.

================================================================================
FORGE DOMAIN
================================================================================
XGE p18

The gods of the forge are patrons of artisans who work with metal, from a humble blacksmith who keeps a village in horseshoes and plow blades to the mighty elf artisan whose diamond-tipped arrows of mithral have felled demon lords. The gods of the forge teach that, with patience and hard work, even the most intractable metal can be transformed from a lump of ore to a beautifully wrought object.

FORGE DOMAIN SPELLS
Cleric Level | Spells
1st          | identify, searing smite
3rd          | heat metal, magic weapon
5th          | elemental weapon, protection from energy
7th          | fabricate, wall of fire
9th          | animate objects, creation

--- Bonus Proficiency (Level 1) ---
XGE p18

When you choose this domain at 1st level, you gain proficiency with heavy armor and smith's tools.

--- Blessing of the Forge (Level 1) ---
XGE p18

At 1st level, you gain the ability to imbue magic into a weapon or armor. At the end of a long rest, you can touch one nonmagical object that is a suit of armor or a simple or martial weapon. Until the end of your next long rest or until you die, the object becomes a magic item, granting a +1 bonus to AC if it's armor or a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls if it's a weapon.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

--- Channel Divinity: Artisan's Blessing (Level 2) ---
XGE p18

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to create simple items.

You conduct an hour-long ritual that crafts a nonmagical item that must include some metal: a simple or martial weapon, a suit of armor, ten pieces of ammunition, a set of tools, or another metal object. The creation is completed at the end of the hour, coalescing in an unoccupied space of your choice on a surface within 5 feet of you.

The thing you create can be something that is worth no more than 100 gp. As part of this ritual, you must lay out metal, which can include coins, with a value equal to the creation. The metal irretrievably coalesces and transforms into the creation at the ritual's end, magically forming even nonmetal parts of the creation.

--- Soul of the Forge (Level 6) ---
XGE p18

Starting at 6th level, your mastery of the forge grants you special abilities:
- You gain resistance to fire damage.
- While wearing heavy armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

--- Saint of Forge and Fire (Level 17) ---
XGE p18

At 17th level, your blessed affinity with fire and metal becomes more powerful:
- You gain immunity to fire damage.
- While wearing heavy armor, you have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage from nonmagical attacks.

================================================================================
GRAVE DOMAIN
================================================================================
XGE p19

Gods of the grave watch over the line between life and death. To these deities, death and the afterlife are a foundational part of the multiverse. To desecrate the peace of the dead is an abomination. Followers of these deities seek to put wandering spirits to rest, destroy the undead, and ease the suffering of the dying.

GRAVE DOMAIN SPELLS
Cleric Level | Spells
1st          | bane, false life
3rd          | gentle repose, ray of enfeeblement

7th          | blight, death ward
9th          | antilife shell, raise dead

--- Circle of Mortality (Level 1) ---
XGE p19

At 1st level, you gain the ability to manipulate the line between life and death. When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore hit points with a spell to a creature at 0 hit points, you instead use the highest number possible for each die.

In addition, you learn the spare the dying cantrip, which doesn't count against the number of cleric cantrips you know. For you, it has a range of 30 feet, and you can cast it as a bonus action.

--- Eyes of the Grave (Level 1) ---
XGE p19

At 1st level, you gain the ability to occasionally sense the presence of the undead, whose existence is an insult to the natural cycle of life. As an action, you can open your awareness to magically detect undead. Until the end of your next turn, you know the location of any undead within 60 feet of you that isn't behind total cover and that isn't protected from divination magic. This sense doesn't tell you anything about a creature's capabilities or identity.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

--- Channel Divinity: Path to the Grave (Level 2) ---
XGE p19

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to mark another creature's life force for termination.

As an action, you choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you, cursing it until the end of your next turn. The next time you or an ally of yours hits the cursed creature with an attack, the creature has vulnerability to all of that attack's damage, and then the curse ends.

--- Sentinel at Death's Door (Level 6) ---
XGE p19

At 6th level, you gain the ability to impede death's progress. As a reaction when you or a creature you can see within 30 feet of you suffers a critical hit, you can turn that hit into a normal hit. Any effects triggered by a critical hit are canceled.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

--- Keeper of Souls (Level 17) ---
XGE p19

Starting at 17th level, you can seize a trace of vitality from a parting soul and use it to heal the living. When an enemy you can see dies within 60 feet of you, you or one creature of your choice that is within 60 feet of you regains hit points equal to the enemy's number of Hit Dice. You can use this feature only if you aren't incapacitated. Once you use it, you can't do so again until the start of your next turn.

================================================================================
KNOWLEDGE DOMAIN
================================================================================
FRHoF p18

The Knowledge Domain values learning and understanding above all. Clerics who tap into this domain study esoteric lore, collect old tomes, delve into secret places, and examine the processes of the mind. To them, knowledge is more valuable than material wealth, and learning is an act of worship.

--- Blessings of Knowledge (Level 3) ---
FRHoF p18

You gain proficiency with one type of Artisan's Tools of your choice and in two of the following skills of your choice: Arcana, History, Nature, or Religion. You have Expertise in those two skills.

When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Knowledge Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

As part of that action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components.

--- Unfettered Mind (Level 6) ---
FRHoF p18

You gain telepathy out to 60 feet. When you use this telepathy, you can simultaneously contact a number of creatures equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one).

Additionally, you gain proficiency in Intelligence saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain saving throw proficiency with one ability in which you lack it.

--- Divine Foreknowledge (Level 17) ---
FRHoF p19

As a Bonus Action, you magically expand your mind to the future. For 1 hour, you have Advantage on D20 Tests. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of this feature by expending a level 6+ spell slot (no action required).

================================================================================
LIFE DOMAIN
================================================================================
PHB'24 p73

The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.

--- Preserve Life (Level 3) ---
PHB'24 p73

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.

--- Blessed Healer (Level 6) ---
PHB'24 p74

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one creature other than you, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot's level.

--- Supreme Healing (Level 17) ---
PHB'24 p74

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don't roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

================================================================================
LIGHT DOMAIN
================================================================================
PHB'24 p74

The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 30-foot Emanation originating from yourself. Any magical Darkness—such as that created by the Darkness spell—in that area is dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to 2d10 plus your Cleric level on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

--- Warding Flare (Level 3) ---
PHB'24 p74

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself makes an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to impose Disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before it hits or misses.

================================================================================
NATURE DOMAIN
================================================================================
PHB'14 p61

Gods of nature are as varied as the natural world itself. Druids revere nature as a whole and might serve one of these deities, practicing mysterious rites and reciting all-but-forgotten prayers in their own secret tongue. But many of these gods have clerics as well, champions who take a more active role in advancing the interests of a particular nature god.

================================================================================
ORDER DOMAIN
================================================================================
TCE p31

The Order Domain represents discipline, as well as devotion to a society or an institution and strict obedience to the laws governing it. The ideal of order is obedience to the law above all else, rather than to a specific individual or the passing influence of emotion or popular rule.

--- Embodiment of the Law (Level 6) ---
TCE p31

At 6th level, you become remarkably adept at channeling magical energy to compel others.

If you cast a spell of the enchantment school using a spell slot of 1st level or higher, you can change the spell's casting time to 1 bonus action for this casting, provided the spell's casting time is normally 1 action.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a long rest.

--- Order's Wrath (Level 17) ---
TCE p31

Starting at 17th level, enemies you designate for destruction wilt under the combined efforts of you and your allies. If you deal your Divine Strike damage to a creature on your turn, you can curse that creature until the start of your next turn. The next time one of your allies hits the cursed creature with an attack, the target also takes 2d8 psychic damage, and the curse ends. You can curse a creature in this way only once per turn.

================================================================================
PEACE DOMAIN
================================================================================
TCE p32

The balm of peace thrives at the heart of healthy communities, between friendly nations, and in the souls of the kindhearted. The gods of peace inspire people of all sorts to resolve conflict and to stand up against those forces that try to prevent peace from flourishing.

You can forge an empowering bond among people who are at peace with one another.

You create a magical bond among them for 10 minutes or until you use this feature again. While any bonded creature is within 30 feet of another, the creature can roll a d4 and add the number rolled to an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw it makes. Each creature can add the d4 no more than once per turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

--- Channel Divinity: Balm of Peace (Level 2) ---
TCE p32

You can use your Channel Divinity to make your very presence a soothing balm. As an action, you can move up to your speed, without provoking opportunity attacks, and when you move within 5 feet of any other creature during this action, you can restore a number of hit points to that creature equal to 2d6 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1 hit point). A creature can receive this healing only once whenever you take this action.

--- Protective Bond (Level 6) ---
TCE p32

The bond you forge between people helps them protect each other. When a creature affected by your Emboldening Bond feature is about to take damage, a second bonded creature within 30 feet of the first can use its reaction to teleport to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of the first creature. The second creature then takes all the damage instead.

--- Expansive Bond (Level 17) ---
TCE p32

The benefits of your Emboldening Bond and Protective Bond features now work when the creatures are within 60 feet of each other. Moreover, when a creature uses Protective Bond to take someone else's damage, the creature has resistance to that damage.
