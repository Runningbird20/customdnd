ARTIFICER CLASS

========================================
LEVEL 1 FEATURES
========================================

SPELLCASTING
You have learned how to channel magical energy through objects.

Tools Required: You produce your Artificer spells through tools. You can use Thieves' Tools, Tinker's Tools, or another kind of Artisan's Tools with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus, and you must have one of those focuses in hand when you cast an Artificer spell (meaning the spell has an M component when you cast it).

Cantrips: You know two Artificer cantrips of your choice. Acid Splash and Prestidigitation are recommended.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can replace one of your cantrips from this feature with another Artificer cantrip of your choice.

When you reach Artificer levels 10 and 14, you learn another Artificer cantrip of your choice.

Spell Slots: You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.

Prepared Spells of Level 1+: You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Artificer spells. Cure Wounds and Grease are recommended.

The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Artificer levels. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Artificer spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

If another Artificer feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those don't count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Artificer spells for you.

Changing Your Prepared Spells: Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Artificer spells for which you have spell slots.

Spellcasting Ability: Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Artificer spells.

---

TINKER'S MAGIC
You know the Mending cantrip.

As a Magic action while holding Tinker's Tools, you can create one item in an unoccupied space within 5 feet of yourself, choosing from: Ball Bearings, Basket, Bedroll, Bell, Blanket, Block and Tackle, Bottle (Glass), Bucket, Caltrops, Candle, Crowbar, Flask, Grappling Hook, Hunting Trap, Jug, Lamp, Manacles, Net, Oil, Paper, Parchment, Pole, Pouch, Rope, Sack, Shovel, Spikes (Iron), String, Tinderbox, Torch, Vial.

The item lasts until you finish a Long Rest, at which point it vanishes.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

========================================
LEVEL 2 FEATURES
========================================

REPLICATE MAGIC ITEM
You have learned arcane plans that you use to make magic items.

Plans Known: When you gain this feature, choose four plans to learn from the Magic Item Plans (Artificer Level 2+) table. Bag of Holding, Cap of Water Breathing, Sending Stones, and Wand of the War Mage are recommended. Whenever you gain an Artificer level, you can replace one of the plans you know with a new plan for which you qualify.

You learn another plan of your choice when you reach certain Artificer levels. When you choose a plan to learn, you choose it from any Magic Item Plans table for which you qualify; your qualification is based on your Artificer level.

Creating an Item: When you finish a Long Rest, you can create one or two different magic items if you have Tinker's Tools in hand. Each item is based on one of the plans you know for this feature.

If a created item requires Attunement, you can attune yourself to it the instant you create it. If you decide to attune to the item later, you must do so using the normal process for Attunement.

When you reach certain Artificer levels, the number of magic items you can create at the end of a Long Rest increases. Each item you create must be based on a different plan you know.

You can't have more magic items from this feature than the number shown in the Magic Items column for your level. If you try to exceed your maximum number of magic items for this feature, the oldest item vanishes, and then the new item appears.

Duration: A magic item created by this feature functions as the normal magic item, except its magic isn't permanent; when you die, the magic item vanishes after 1d4 days. If you replace a plan you know with a new plan, any magic item created with the replaced plan immediately vanishes.

If an item that you created with this feature is a container, such as a Bag of Holding, and it vanishes, its contents harmlessly appear in and around its space.

Spellcasting Focus: You can use any Wand or Weapon created by this feature as a Spellcasting Focus in lieu of using a set of Artisan's Tools.

Any spell slot you create with this feature vanishes when you finish a Long Rest.

SPELL-STORING ITEM
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can touch one Simple or Martial weapon or one item that you can use as a Spellcasting Focus, and you store a spell in it, choosing a level 1, 2, or 3 Artificer spell that has a casting time of an action and doesn't require a Material component that is consumed by the spell (you needn't have the spell prepared).

While holding the object, a creature can take a Magic action to produce the spell's effect from it, using your spellcasting ability modifier. If the spell requires Concentration, the creature must concentrate. Once a creature has used the object to produce the spell's effect, the object can't be used this way again until the start of the creature's next turn.

The elixir appears in a vial, and the vial vanishes when the elixir is drunk or poured out. If any elixir remains when you finish a Long Rest, the elixir and its vial vanish.

Drinking an Elixir: As a Bonus Action, a creature can drink the elixir or administer it to another creature within 5 feet of itself.

Creating Additional Elixirs: As a Magic action while holding Alchemist's Supplies, you can expend one spell slot to create another elixir. When you do so, you choose its effect from the Experimental Elixir table rather than rolling.

When you reach certain Artificer levels, you can make an additional elixir at the end of each Long Rest: a total of three at level 5, four at level 9, and five at level 15.

---

LEVEL 9: RESTORATIVE REAGENTS
You can cast Lesser Restoration without expending a spell slot and without preparing the spell, provided you use Alchemist's Supplies as the Spellcasting Focus. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

---

LEVEL 15: CHEMICAL MASTERY
Alchemical Eruption: When you cast an Artificer spell that deals Acid, Fire, or Poison damage to a target, you can also deal 2d8 Force damage to that target. You can use this benefit only once on each of your turns.

Benefits while wearing Arcane Armor:
- No Strength Requirement: If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the Arcane Armor lacks this requirement for you.
- Quick Don and Doff: You can don or doff the armor as a Utilize action. The armor can't be removed against your will.
- Spellcasting Focus: You can use the Arcane Armor as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells.

---

LEVEL 3: ARMOR MODEL
You can customize your Arcane Armor. Choose one of the following armor models: Dreadnaught, Guardian, or Infiltrator. The model you choose gives you special benefits while you wear it.

Each model includes a special weapon. When you attack with that weapon, you can add your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, to the attack and damage rolls.

You can change the armor's model whenever you finish a Short or Long Rest if you have Smith's Tools in hand.

DREADNAUGHT MODEL:
- Force Demolisher: An arcane wrecking ball or sledgehammer projects from your armor. The demolisher counts as a Simple Melee weapon with the Reach property, and it deals 1d10 Force damage on a hit. If you hit a creature that is at least one size smaller than you, you can push the creature up to 10 feet straight away from yourself or pull the creature up to 10 feet toward yourself.
- Giant Stature: As a Bonus Action, you transform and enlarge your armor for 1 minute. For the duration, your reach increases by 5 feet, and if you are smaller than Large, you become Large. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

GUARDIAN MODEL:
- Thunder Pulse: You can discharge concussive blasts with strikes from your armor. The pulse counts as a Simple Melee weapon and deals 1d8 Thunder damage on a hit. A creature hit by the pulse has Disadvantage on attack rolls against targets other than you until the start of your next turn.
- Defensive Field: While Bloodied, you can take a Bonus Action to gain Temporary Hit Points equal to your Artificer level. You lose these Temporary Hit Points if you doff the armor.

INFILTRATOR MODEL:
- Lightning Launcher: A gemlike node appears on your armor, from which you can shoot bolts of lightning. The launcher counts as a Simple Ranged weapon with a normal range of 90 feet and a long range of 300 feet, and it deals 1d6 Lightning damage on a hit. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with the launcher, you can deal an extra 1d6 Lightning damage to that target.
- Powered Steps: Your Speed increases by 5 feet.
- Dampening Field: You have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. If the armor imposes Disadvantage on such checks, the Advantage and Disadvantage cancel each other.

---

LEVEL 5: EXTRA ATTACK
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

---

LEVEL 9: IMPROVED ARMORER
Armor Replication: You learn an additional plan for your Replicate Magic Item feature, and it must be in the Armor category. If you replace that plan, you must replace it with another Armor plan. In addition, you can create an additional item with that feature, and the item must also be in the Armor category.

Improved Arsenal: You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with the special weapon of your Arcane Armor model.

---

LEVEL 15: PERFECTED ARMOR
Your Arcane Armor gains additional benefits based on its model:

DREADNAUGHT:
- The damage die of your Force Demolisher increases to 2d6 Force damage.
- When you use your Giant Stature, your reach increases by 10 feet, your size can increase to Large or Huge (your choice), and you have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws for the duration.

GUARDIAN:
- The damage die of your Thunder Pulse increases to 1d10 Thunder damage.
- When a Huge or smaller creature you can see ends its turn within 30 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to magically force that creature to make a Strength saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you pull the creature up to 25 feet directly toward you to an unoccupied space. If you pull the target to a space within 5 feet of yourself, you can make a melee weapon attack against it as part of this Reaction. You can take this Reaction a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

INFILTRATOR:
- The damage die of your Lightning Launcher increases to 2d6 Lightning damage. Any creature that takes Lightning damage from your Lightning Launcher glimmers with magical light until the start of your next turn. The glimmering creature sheds Dim Light in a 5-foot radius, and it has Disadvantage on attack rolls against you.
- As a Bonus Action, you can gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed until the end of the current turn. You can take this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

LEVEL 3: ELDRITCH CANNON
Using Smith's Tools or Woodcarver's Tools, you can take a Magic action to create a Small or Tiny Eldritch Cannon in an unoccupied space on a horizontal surface within 5 feet of yourself. You determine its appearance, including whether you carry it or not (and your choice of legs or wheels, for the latter). It disappears if it is reduced to 0 Hit Points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as a Magic action.

Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest or expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while you already have one.

---

LEVEL 5: ARCANE FIREARM
When you finish a Long Rest, you can use Woodcarver's Tools to carve special sigils into a Rod, Staff, Wand, or Martial Ranged weapon and thereby turn it into your Arcane Firearm. The sigils disappear from the object if you later carve them on a different item. The sigils otherwise last indefinitely.

You can use your Arcane Firearm as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells. When you cast an Artificer spell through the firearm, roll 1d8, and you gain a bonus to one of the spell's damage rolls equal to the number rolled.

---

LEVEL 9: EXPLOSIVE CANNON
Every Eldritch Cannon you create is now more destructive. You gain the following benefits:

Detonate: When your cannon takes damage, you can take a Reaction to command the cannon to detonate if you are within 60 feet of it. Doing so destroys the cannon and forces each creature within 20 feet of it to make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 3d10 Force damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Firepower: The cannon's damage rolls and the number of Temporary Hit Points granted by Protector increase by 1d8.

---

LEVEL 15: FORTIFIED POSITION
You're a master at forming well-defended emplacements using your Eldritch Cannon. You gain the following benefits:

Double Firepower: You can now have two cannons at the same time, and you can create two with the same Magic action. (If you expend a spell slot to create the first cannon, you must expend another spell slot to create the second.) You can activate both of them with the same Bonus Action, ordering them to use the same activation option or different ones. You can't create a third cannon while you have two.

Shimmering Field Projection: You and your allies have Half Cover while within 10 feet of your Eldritch Cannon.

---

Your combat training and your experiments with magic have paid off in two ways:

Arcane Empowerment: When you attack with a magic weapon, you can use your Intelligence modifier, instead of your Strength or Dexterity modifier, for the attack and damage rolls.

Weapon Knowledge: You gain proficiency with Martial weapons. You can use a weapon with which you have proficiency as a Spellcasting Focus for your Artificer spells.

---

LEVEL 3: STEEL DEFENDER
Your tinkering has borne you a companion, a Steel Defender. You determine the defender's appearance and whether it has two legs or four; your choices don't affect the defender's game statistics.

The defender is Friendly to you and your allies and obeys you. It vanishes if you die.

The Defender in Combat: In combat, the defender acts during your turn. It can move and take its Reaction on its own, but the only action it takes is the Dodge action unless you take a Bonus Action to command it to take an action. If you have the Incapacitated condition, the defender acts on its own and isn't limited to the Dodge action.

Restoring or Replacing the Defender: If the defender has died within the last hour, you can take a Magic action to touch it and expend a spell slot. The defender returns to life after 1 minute with all its Hit Points restored.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can create a new defender if you have Smith's Tools in hand. If you already have a defender from this feature, the first one vanishes.

---

LEVEL 5: EXTRA ATTACK
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. You can forgo one of your attacks when you take the Attack action to command your Steel Defender to take the Force-Empowered Rend action.

---

LEVEL 9: ARCANE JOLT
When either you hit a target with an attack roll using a magic weapon or your Steel Defender hits a target, you can channel magical energy through the strike to create one of the following effects:

Destructive Energy: The target takes an extra 2d6 Force damage.

Restorative Energy: Choose one creature or object you can see within 30 feet of the target. Healing energy flows into the chosen recipient, restoring 2d6 Hit Points to it.

You can use this energy a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), but you can do so no more than once per turn. You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

---

LEVEL 15: IMPROVED DEFENDER
Your Arcane Jolt and Steel Defender have become more powerful, granting these benefits:

Improved Jolt: The extra damage and healing of your Arcane Jolt both increase to 4d6.

Improved Deflection: Whenever your Steel Defender uses its Deflect Attack, the attacker takes Force damage equal to 1d4 plus your Intelligence modifier.

-------------------
CARTOGRAPHER SUBCLASS

Chart Advantageous Courses through Turmoil

LEVEL 3: TOOLS OF THE TRADE
Tool Proficiency: You gain proficiency with Calligrapher's Supplies and Cartographer's Tools. If you already have one of these proficiencies, you gain proficiency with one other type of Artisan's Tools of your choice (or with two other types if you have both).

5 | Locate Object, Mind Spike
9 | Call Lightning, Clairvoyance
13 | Banishment, Locate Creature
17 | Scrying, Teleportation Circle

---

LEVEL 3: ADVENTURER'S ATLAS
Whenever you finish a Long Rest while holding Cartographer's Tools, you can use that tool to create a set of magical maps by touching at least two creatures (one of whom can be yourself), up to a maximum number of creatures equal to 1 plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum of two creatures). Each target receives a magical map, which constantly updates to show the relative position of all the map holders but is illegible to all others. The maps last until you die or until you use this feature again, at which point any existing maps created by this feature immediately vanish.

While carrying the map, a target gains the following benefits:

Awareness: The target adds 1d4 to its Initiative rolls.

Positioning: The target knows the location of all other map holders that are on the same plane of existence as itself. When casting a spell or creating another effect that requires being able to see the effect's target, a map holder can target another map holder regardless of sight or cover, so long as the other map holder is still within the effect's range.

---

LEVEL 3: MAPPING MAGIC
Illuminated Cartography: You can cast Faerie Fire without expending a spell slot, outlining the affected creatures as if in ink. You can do so a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

Portal Jump: On your turn, you can spend an amount of movement equal to half your Speed (round down) to teleport to an unoccupied space you can see within 10 feet of yourself or within 5 feet of a creature that is within 30 feet of you and holding one of your Adventurer's Atlas maps. You can't use this benefit if your Speed is 0.

---

LEVEL 5: GUIDED PRECISION
Once per turn, whenever you cast a spell from your Cartographer Spells list or hit a creature affected by your Faerie Fire with an attack roll, you can add your Intelligence modifier to one damage roll of the spell or attack.

In addition, taking damage can't cause you to lose Concentration on Faerie Fire.

---

LEVEL 9: INGENIOUS MOVEMENT
When you use your Flash of Genius, you or a willing creature of your choice that you can see within 30 feet of yourself can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see as part of that same Reaction.

---

LEVEL 15: SUPERIOR ATLAS
Your Adventurer's Atlas improves, gaining the following benefits:

Safe Haven: When a map holder would be reduced to 0 Hit Points but not killed outright, that creature can destroy its map. The creature's Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Artificer level, and the creature is teleported to an unoccupied space within 5 feet of you or another map holder of its choice.

Unerring Path: If you are one of the map holders for your Adventurer's Atlas, you can cast Find the Path without expending a spell slot, without preparing the spell, and without needing spell components. Once you use this benefit, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest.
